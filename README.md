# Soil Site

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the design challenge and by the current climate crisis, to create project related to sustainability

## What it does
Soil Site takes in an image of soil as input, and uses tensorflow machine learning to detect the soil type and the soil composition. Based on this, it will provide further detail about the soil and what plants and crops can best be grown in the soil
